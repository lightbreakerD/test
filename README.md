# FingAR
The easy AR indoor navigation App to help you find your destination room immediately. 

## Short Info about the Project
It's easy to find a building through Google Maps, but: Once you are inside a bulding on the TUM-Campus, 
like the MI, its more difficult to find a specific Room. There are so many Rooms in different Fingers of the MI
and it is rather unintuitive to find the direct way to the right room fast.

The FingAR App solves this problem by showing you the fastest path to your destination room from your current 
position, whereever your are in the building.

Select the room you want to go to in the App, click on navigate and the path to your destination will 
be drawn in AR inside the App. Now you only need to follow the line!
